# Raspberry Pi Vertical Hydroponic System  

## Whatâ€™s This About?  
So, Iâ€™m building a vertical hydroponic system with a Raspberry Pi to automate watering plants. Why? Because I live in a small space and need my plants to survive without constant attention (I love them, but I'm busy). Plus, they keep dying otherwise.

## The Journey So Far  

### Building the Tower  
First, I went with a PVC pipe tower. Cut some holes, added net cups, and boom â€“ the plants have a home. Iâ€™m 3D printing custom connectors to make everything fit together nicely. It's like a plant skyscraper but cooler. The water reservoir is at the bottom â€“ because, you know, gravity.  

### Water Circulation: Letâ€™s Make It Flow  
Next, Iâ€™m working on getting the water pump and tubing in place. The idea is to circulate water through the tower to keep the plants hydrated without flooding the place (hopefully). Iâ€™m still debating between different pumps. There are too many choices, and my brain hurts.  

### Automating It All  
Once the tower is up and running, itâ€™s time to let the Raspberry Pi take over. Iâ€™m planning on using some moisture sensors to tell the Pi when the plants are thirsty. If all goes well, itâ€™ll water them on a schedule, and I can just chill while the plants do their thing. Maybe throw in some pH and EC sensors later, just to make me feel like a legit plant scientist.  

### Whatâ€™s Next?  
After everything is automated, I might add a web dashboard to monitor everything. Who doesnâ€™t want to check on their plants from the couch, right? Maybe add LED grow lights so I can pretend I'm a professional grower. Stay tuned for updates, or donâ€™t â€“ up to you.  

## Repo Breakdown  

/STL_Files # 3D-printed parts (because why not?)
/Hardware # Pump, tubing, sensors (the boring but necessary stuff)
/Software # Python scripts for automation (donâ€™t ask me why itâ€™s not working yet)
README.md # This document (obviously)


Letâ€™s hope the plants donâ€™t start plotting against me. ðŸ¤ž
